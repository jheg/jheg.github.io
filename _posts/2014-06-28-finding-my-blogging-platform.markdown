excerpt: and I need a blog!
---

A while ago I decided that I wanted to learn a programming language and after much procrastination I ended up at the gotealeaf online bootcamp for learning ruby and ruby on rails. 

I'll go into more detail on my background in a future post but first of all I needed somewhere to write about my journey and although I have a little experience with wordpress I wanted something different, preferably written in ruby. I asked the question on the #ruby channel on irc and got a huge list of potential solutions. I liked the sound of jekyll as it seems to have decent documentation and its own channel on irc #jekyll. 

In the spirit of explaining things in the way I need things explaining I will try to document each step of what I have done in a really easy to follow format so hopefully anyone wishing to follow the same path may find my experience of use in the future.

I'll probably change the style of this blog from the default template at some point when I want a break from ruby but to be honest I quite like its simplicity. I'll also look to add some other functionality to it like a comments section soon. 

Fingers crossed I'll click save and this will show on my new created blog page!

yay it worked!
