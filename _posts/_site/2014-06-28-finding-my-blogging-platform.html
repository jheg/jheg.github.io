<p>A while ago I decided that I wanted to learn a programming language and after much procrastination I ended up at the gotealeaf online bootcamp for learning ruby and ruby on rails. </p>

<p>I’ll go into more detail on my background in a future post but first of all I needed somewhere to write about my journey and although I have a little experience with wordpress I wanted something different, preferably written in ruby. I asked the question on the #ruby channel on irc and got a huge list of potential solutions. I liked the sound of jekyll as it seems to have decent documentation and its own channel on irc #jekyll. </p>

<p>In the spirit of explaining things in the way I need things explaining I will try to document each step of what I have done in a really easy to follow format so hopefully anyone wishing to follow the same path may find my experience of use in the future.</p>

<p>I’ll probably change the style of this blog from the default template at some point when I want a break from ruby but to be honest I quite like its simplicity. I’ll also look to add some other functionality to it like a comments section soon. </p>

<p>Fingers crossed I’ll click save and this will show on my new created blog page!</p>

<p>yay it worked!</p>
