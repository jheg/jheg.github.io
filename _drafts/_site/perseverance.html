<p>I had the following exercise to complete as part of my pre course at Tealeaf:</p>

<p>exercise explanation goes here</p>

<p>I wrote the following code and it worked!</p>

<p>code goes here</p>

<p>However I was concerned that this only worked when the hash only had 1 pair. What if I added a another pair to the hash and a new array of data to the array will it still work? </p>

<p>example code here  of it not working and assigning nil values</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<p>code here</p>

<p>That works to an extent but only when there are two pairs in the hash so I needed to find another way. I needed to somehow check to see if the first array was empty and if it was delete it from the array before looping through once more. I headed on over to ruby docs and looked through the available array classes and re wrote my program:</p>

<p>Problem fixed!</p>
