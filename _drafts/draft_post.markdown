Up until recently the only languages I'd been exposed to were html, css, and the tiniest bit of javascript and php. The latter two there are mainly as a result of surrounding myself with friends that code for a living by way of hangin out in irc (internet relay chat). 

Thats actually a really important part of my journey - in fact the most important part. About five years ago I decided I wanted to learn how to make a website for my small business and from a very early stage I realised the importance of internet forums and chat rooms. It taught me that the developer community was in the most part, incredibly supportive of anyone looking to learn the craft of code. I've met some fantastic people people over the past few years online and now regard these people as true friends even though I've never met a single one of them. 8 of us started a web design forum about a year ago, <a href="http://thewebdesignforum.co.uk">thewebdesignforum</a>.
